## Notes
### Flashing
1. If you only change the keymap, you can just flash to the master side. For Sofle series, master is on the left. That means you dont need to flash left and right.<br>

2. If double press doesnt call out the new folder to drag your uf2, check MY COMPUTER any new drive, or you have to double press even faster. You also can use key combination above by holding thumb and press the green button twice.
3. You dont need to delete any files in nicenano folder, just drag your new right uf2 to it and ignore and skip any error.
4. Normally doesnt need to re-pair after format. It will paired automatically.
